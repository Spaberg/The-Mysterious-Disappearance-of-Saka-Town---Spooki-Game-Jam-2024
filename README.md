# üéÉ Spooki Game Jam 2024 - [The Mysterious Disappearance of Saka Town]

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **[The Mysterious Disappearance of Saka Town]**, a game developed in 48 hours during the **Spooki Game Jam 2024**. This was a fast-paced, fun, and chaotic project, and the main focus was to deliver a playable game within a short timeframe. Please note that the code quality and commit messages may not reflect best practices due to the rushed nature of the game jam.
